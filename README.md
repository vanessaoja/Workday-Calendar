# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

This project enatailed expressions I was not familiar with. My motivation was to understand loops and variable/functitons better.

I bult this project to further my knowledge in Javascript/JQuery, the latter being a new concept.

This project solves time keeping for the average user. The Work Day Schedular tracks events, reminders, or any other information the user wishes to track and take notes of.

During this project I learned about JSON, the extension for Javascript, beginning with the syntax, "name":"value" . Working with key/name and values, it is important when are where to put "". For example, the key is always in double ". Strings are as well in double " while numbers and booleans are not, ie: "name":1. The array syntax is [{"name":"value"}, {"name":"value}]
To create a string in the console.log we must use backticks ('). Since this does not create a Javascript object the use of pasring is involved (JSON.parse). This allows the code to be read as if it was in Javascript, allowing the use for indexes/arrays etc.

## Usage

In order to use the Workday Calendar the user locates the present and future time slots within the page. There they can type any information they wish then save it by clicking on the save ison to the right of the screen. Refreshing the screen is not a concern, the information will still be there.
