# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
This project enatailed expressions I was not familiar with. My motivation was to understand loops and variable/functitons better.

I bult this project to further my knowledge in Javascript/JQuery, the latter being a new concept.

This project solves time keeping for the average user. The Work Day Schedular tracks events, reminders, or any other information the user wishes to track and take notes of.

During this project I learned about JSON, the extension for Javascript, beginning with the syntax, "name":"value" . Working with key and values, it is important when are where to put "". For example, the key is always in double ". Strings are as well in double " while numbers and booleans are not, ie: "name":1. The array syntax is [{"name":"value"}, {"name":"value}]
To create a string in the console.log we must use backticks ('). Since this does not create a Javascript object the use of pasring is involved (JSON.parse). This allows the code to be read as if it was in Javascript, allowing the use for indexes/arrays etc.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
